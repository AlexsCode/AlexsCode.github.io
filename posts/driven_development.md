### Testing Driven Development
    Summary

    Creating the tests for the code before writing the code.

    After creating the tests, write the code and as tests start passing, keep expanding the test coverage.
    
    This approach leads to more thorough testing as well as more modular testable code.

    Scenario

    Thoroughly documented design which requires implementing.
    Alternatively when the design does not have a high degree of unknown complexities.
